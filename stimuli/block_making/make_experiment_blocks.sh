#Piano Duet study: this script makes the files block{1..12}.coll.txt for Max to read in

#to run:
# >> ./make_experiment_blocks.sh blockorder_VERSION.csv pairfolder
# for example: ./make_experiment_blocks.sh blockorder_1.csv MW_TD

#The coll file orders the information in the following left to right columns:
#trial number,
#practice/non-practice (1/2)
#humanK1-maxK2 / humanK1 - humanK2 / maxK1 - humanK2 (1/2/3)
#score (1/2/3/4)
#which keyboard first (odd/even, 1/2)
#which phrase of keyboard 1 is the deviant in (1/2/3/4) 
#which phrase of keyboard 2 is the deviant in (1/2/3/4)
#which note for keyboard 1 is the deviant in (4/5) 
#which note for keyboard 2 is the deviant in (4/5) 
#does the deviant descend or ascend for keyboard 1 (-2/2) 
#does the deviant descend or ascend for keyboard 2 (-2/2)
#trigger code identifying the trial

##REQUIREMENTS TO RUN
#bash 4.2 and above
